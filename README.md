# Front End Coding Project Submission

Here is my submission for the coding project.

- Most of the my work is in index.html, location.js, and location.cs.
- I used a few other libraries: jquery, angular, bootrstrap, fontawesome.
- For the Google Map, I used something I had written before for my own use. I made slight modifications for this project, but for the most part treated it like a utility library.
- I added a states.json config for state names.

A breakdown of the features I implemented.

- All locations are displayed in the dialog
- Locations grouped by state
- Search filters locations based on all fields (inlcuding full state name) and updates the results in real time.
- Note: A message is shown if no locations match the search query.
- Select All/Deselect All select all locations that are currently displayed in the list. 
- Clicking "Add" Button adds the ID and Name fields to the display of each selected location in the list.
- # of selected locations displayed. Note: I didn't get to "Show Selected", so I changed the display slightly.
- Dialog works as a pop up and hosted in page
- Select All works for a state
- Selected locations display in a map with a red pin
- Unselected locations display in a map with a grey pin
- I didn't get the full column behavior and map mentioned, but I added some responsiveness. From widest to most narrow: two columns and map, one column and map, one column full width.

Please let me know if you have any questions, thanks.
